This is the repository for the paper "Enhancing the DATF Technique in Differential-Linear Cryptanalysis".
We provide the source code for the DATF technique, which can estimate biases and verify our results.
All of these source codes can be executed directly.
The use of OpenMP enables the program to be parallelized.


This repository contains two folders.

- Enhanced DATF
  - These codes implement the Enhanced DATF technique for four cryptographic algorithms and can be used to theoretically estimate bias.
- Experiment
  - These codes are based on experiments designed to calculate the precise bias, which can be used to verify our estimations.
